## 👋 Hi, Context ?

This project is a collaboration between Éloi and Johan.
 
After a talk about creating an application on the Lynx R1, Johan explained that he is working on the creation of a community around Drone Soccer.

The challenge of creating an eSport game on Lynx-R1 that could allows a virtual patrice to real world application triggered our curiosity.

Drone Soccer XR is an attempt of creating an mixed reality experiments around the Drone Soccer world wide eSport that you can find here: https://www.fai.org/drone-sports-soccer

The main goal is to help people that want to learn how to fly drone and programmer that want to learn how to pilote drone.
